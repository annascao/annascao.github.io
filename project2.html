                <p>Track-Atack is a rubber band-shooting gun featuring aim assist / target tracking made in 24 hours for nwHacks. Our goal was to enable users to select a target via a web app and have the system accurately aim and shoot at the chosen target.
                <br><br>
                The setup featured a static base housing two servos, each controlling a mounted mechanism to adjust the pitch and yaw angles of the rubber band shooter. A camera was used to capture the target's position, with the data processed by a web app to identify precise coordinates. These coordinates were transmitted to a Raspberry Pi, which ran a control system to calculate the required adjustments for each servo. 
                <br><br>
                This was a fun learning experience where we got to try out new technologies and tools and it challenged us to think on our feet with limited time! We hope to continue and refine this project!

              <h4>Software</h4>
                <p>
                  Our system relied on a coordinated software architecture split between the Raspberry Pi and a laptop.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>On the Laptop:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The camera feed was processed to detect objects.</li>
                      <li>Users interacted with the visualized feed to select a target.</li>
                      <li>The selected target’s coordinates were sent to the Raspberry Pi via the Flask API.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>On the Raspberry Pi:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The Flask server received the coordinates.</li>
                      <li>The control loop adjusted the servos to aim at the target based on the provided coordinates.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                The laptop hosted the user interface, where a Python-based application utilized YOLOv5 for object detection and SORT for object tracking. Users could interact with the interface to select a target in the live video feed, streamed from a usb camera. OpenCV was used to render the video feed with real-time visual overlays, including bounding boxes and center points. The selected target's coordinates (x, y) were computed and sent via a REST API using HTTP POST requests to the Raspberry Pi.
                <p>A rough concept of the UI, using Three.js to include an interactive element:</p>
                <div class="text-center">
                  <div class="col-6 d-inline-block">
                    <img src="docs/trackatack.gif" alt="GIF" class="img-fluid me-3 mb-3">
                  </div>
                </div>
                The Raspberry Pi functioned as the control center for the hardware. It hosted a Flask server that received target coordinates from the laptop's application. These coordinates were processed in a control system that calculated the adjustments for the servos controlling the rubber band shooter’s pitch and yaw.

                <h4>Things We Learned / Issues We Ran Into</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Initially, we wanted the object detection and video processing to be done on the Pi. We then wanted to video stream to the web-app. Unfortunately, with the Pi 3, we were struggling to run the entire project and there were computational limitations. Therefore, offloaded the heavy computational tasks to the laptop.
                  </li>
                  <li>The servos moved in bigger intervals than expected because we used software-generated PWM signals. The lack of precise timing meant the signals were not perfect and the servos jiggled back and forth a bit.
                  </li>
                  <li>The rubber bands we brought were too thick. Luckily, there was Bánh mì for dinner and we were able to collect the rubber bands from the sandwich packaging which were a perfect size!
